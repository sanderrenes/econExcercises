## Getting involved in development ## 
Developing materials in Grasple is free for anyone. 
You can copy exercises to your own repository to create new, or improved exercises as you see fit.
If you have suggested improvements for changes to exercises in the main set, or want to add your own exercises and subjects to this set, please let the maintainer of the
exercises know and update the table in the development page.

If you feel like building exercises, but don't know where to start, please also check the development page for open requests and active developments. That way we can ensure we are not working on the same things, and contact each other if we have similar topics in mind. 

You can add items to the lists in development and content by branching this web-site and adding items to the relevant file, then make a pull request so that the files can be merged. 
Note that the exercises are maintained on a voluntary basis by other teachers and researchers, so not all requests will be taken up, or responded to quickly.

For the period April 2025 until 1 September 2026, the core developer, Sander Renes (s.renes-1 [at] tudelft.nl), will serve as the maintainer of the set of exercises. After this period, Grasple becomes the maintainer.

for discussions about possible improvements, please use the forum on github.
