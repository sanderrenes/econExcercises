## Getting involved in development ## 
Developing materials in Grasple is free for anyone. You can copy exercises to your own repository to create new, or improved exercises as you see fit.
If you have suggested improvements for changes to exercises in the main set, or want to add your own exercises and subjects to this set, please let the maintainer of the
exercises know.

You can also add items to the list by branching this web-site and adding items to the content file, or by adding items to the list with requested subjects.
Note that the exercises are maintained on a voluntary basis by other teachers and researchers, so not all requests will be taken up, or responded to quickly.

For the period April 2025 until 1 September 2026, the core developer, Sander Renes
(s.renes-1 [at] tudelft.nl), will serve as the maintainer of the set of exercises. After this
period, Grasple becomes the maintainer.

for discussions about possible improvements, please use the forum on github.
