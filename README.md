On Grasple we have the repository named:

**Practice Material for Fundamental Courses in Economics**
[Grasple](https://app.grasple.com/#/repositories/2534/subjects)

The repository is designed as an open, collaborative collection of digital exercises and
supplementary teaching materials for fundamental economics courses. It is structured into subjects
that are often found in economics courses. These subjects allow teachers to identify and integrate
those exercises they need, based on the topics they are interested in. All exercises are available in
English and Dutch. Selected exercises can be implemented through the Grasple platform directly
with a free teacher account.

This repository serves as a repository of exercises for educators, offering adaptable, high-
quality practice materials. Teachers can use these resources to enhance student
engagement, streamline exercise creation, and participate in a broader community
dedicated to open educational practices. Furthermore, these exercises will not require a
review of every new print, new book, or new course but can be taken from one setting to
the next with minimal effort.

**To start using the exercises in your course:**

Create a Grasple course, search for the subjects that are relevant to your course, and add them to your
Grasple course.
Add/invite your students
For teacher accounts: by either giving them the link to register for
your course
For organisations: use your LMS (LTI Integration) or SSO.
To help students navigate the exercises, you can organize the subjects you selected in larger
sets, for instance per week or lecture.
